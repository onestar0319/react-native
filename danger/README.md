If you'd like to make changes to the Dangerfile, find an existing PR and copy the URL.		
		
Then run from the React Native root:		

```
cd danger
npm install
..
node danger/node_modules/.bin/danger pr https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/1		
```

And you will get the responses from parsing the Dangerfile.
