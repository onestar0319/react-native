Hey <person>, thanks for reporting this issue!

We've started using a new website called **[Product Pains](https://productpains.com/product/react-native/?tab=top)** to help the community **prioritize issues**.

We have limited bandwidth, it's therefore important to know which issues should be fixed first. The reason Product Pains works better than github is that people can **vote on issues**. On github it's possible to [sort issues by the number of comments](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acomments-desc) but that gives only a very rough estimate.

If you want to help the community prioritize, go ahead and give [Product Pains](https://productpains.com/product/react-native/?tab=top) a try. You can link to this issue from Product Pains.

There are also other ways to get help - see the [README](https://github.com/facebook/react-native#getting-help).
