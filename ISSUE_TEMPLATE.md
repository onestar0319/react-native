React Native, as you've probably heard, is getting really popular and truth is we're getting a bit overwhelmed by the activity surrounding it. There are just too many issues for us to manage properly.

Here are good ways to get help:

- If you **don't know how to do something** or **not sure you've found a bug**, ask on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native) with the tag `react-native`. StackOverflow is amazing for Q&A and it is likely the community will see and answer your question there.

- If this is a **feature request**, please report it on [Product Pains](https://productpains.com/product/react-native/). It has a ranking feature that lets us focus on the most important issues the community is experiencing.

- Is this something you can debug and fix quickly? **Send a pull request!**

If you want to file a GitHub issue, make sure it is actionable so someone can help:

- Provide **screenshots** where appropriate
- What's the **version** of React Native you're using?
- Does this occur on iOS, Android or both?
- The operating system: Mac, Linux or Windows
