# react-native/tools/eslint

This directory contains ESLint rules for the `react-native` repository itself.
They are configured in `.eslintrc.js` using the `eslint-plugin-lint` package.

For ESLint rules intended for projects that consume React Native, add them to
the `@react-native-community/eslint-plugin` package instead.
