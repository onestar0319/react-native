## Reporting Bugs

Report a single bug per issue.

### Reproducing bugs

- Always provide reproduction steps.
- Use Snack. Try to reproduce your bug on https://snack.expo.io/ first of all.
  If the bug cannot be reproduced using Snack, verify that the issue can be reproduced locally by targeting the latest release candidate. Ideally, check if the issue is present in master as well.
- Do not forget to include sample code that reproduces the issue.

Issues that do not describe a bug or do not follow the template will be closed.
