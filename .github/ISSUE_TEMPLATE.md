## Hey there and thank you for using React Native!

React Native, as you've probably heard, is getting really popular and truth is we're getting a bit overwhelmed by the activity surrounding it. Before opening a new issue, make sure to carefully read the following guidelines.

- Is this something you can **debug and fix**? 
  Send a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
- Have a **usage** question?
  We use GitHub Issues for bugs. Ask your usage question on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native
- Have an idea for a **feature**? 
  Post the feature request on Product Pains, which has a voting system to surface important issues: https://productpains.com/product/react-native/

      Issues without sufficient information will be labeled 'Needs more information' and will be closed until there is enough information.
