# FlexLayout Source Code

The react-native repo is exposing this subset of the source code for the FlexLayout layout engine for exploratory purposes. We're currently experimenting with this alternative layout engine for Yoga, which we hope might help to address some of the pain points brought by the community over the years.

This inclusion of the new files in the repository can be safely ignored as they will have no functional impact on end users during this phase, ie. APK size will not be affected, and the layout API and functionality will remain entirely unchanged.

Please also note that we also will not yet be considering feature or pull requests for the FlexLayout engine at this point in time. Feel free to comment in the community discussions if you have any concerns or questions related to FlexLayout:
