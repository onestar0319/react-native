Container that allows to flip left and right between child views. Each
child view of the `ViewPagerAndroid` will be treated as a separate page
and will be stretched to fill the `ViewPagerAndroid`.

It is important all children are `<View>`s and not composite components.
You can set style properties like `padding` or `backgroundColor` for each
child. It is also important that each child have a `key` prop.

Example:

```
render: function() {
  return (
    <ViewPagerAndroid
      style={styles.viewPager}
      initialPage={0}>
      <View style={styles.pageStyle} key="1">
        <Text>First page</Text>
      </View>
      <View style={styles.pageStyle} key="2">
        <Text>Second page</Text>
      </View>
    </ViewPagerAndroid>
  );
}

...

var styles = {
  ...
  viewPager: {
    flex: 1
  },
  pageStyle: {
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  }
}
```
