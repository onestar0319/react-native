  <h3>Project with Native Code Required</h3>
  <p>
    This API only works in projects made with <code>react-native init</code> or in those made with Create React Native App which have since ejected. For more information about ejecting, please see the <a href="https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/EJECTING.md" target="_blank">guide</a> on the Create React Native App repository.

`AppRegistry` is the JavaScript entry point to running all React Native apps. App root components should register themselves with `AppRegistry.registerComponent()`, then the native system can load the bundle for the app and then actually run the app when it's ready by invoking `AppRegistry.runApplication()`.

To "stop" an application when a view should be destroyed, call `AppRegistry.unmountApplicationComponentAtRootTag()` with the tag that was passed into `runApplication()`. These should always be used as a pair.
 
`AppRegistry` should be `require`d early in the `require` sequence to make sure the JavaScript execution environment is set up before other modules are `require`d.
