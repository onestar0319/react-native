## Requirements

1. OS X - This repo only contains the iOS implementation right now, and Xcode only runs on Mac.
2. New to Xcode?  [Download it](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from the Mac App Store.
3. [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is the recommended way to install node, watchman, and flow.
4. `brew install node`. New to [node](https://nodejs.org/) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)?
5. `brew install watchman`. We recommend installing [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html), otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug.
6. `brew install flow`. If you want to use [flow](http://www.flowtype.org).

## Quick start

- `npm install -g react-native-cli`
- `react-native init AwesomeProject`

In the newly created folder `AwesomeProject/`

- Open `AwesomeProject.xcodeproj` and hit run in Xcode.
- Open `index.ios.js` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
- Hit cmd+R in your iOS simulator to reload the app and see your change!

Congratulations! You've just successfully run and modified your first React Native app.
