Welcome to React Native! This page will help you install React Native on
your system, so that you can build apps with it right away. If you already
have React Native installed, you can skip ahead to the
[Tutorial](docs/tutorial.html).

The instructions are a bit different depending on your development operating system, and whether you want to start developing for iOS or Android. If you
want to develop for both iOS and Android, that's fine - you just have to pick
one to start with, since the setup is a bit different.

<block class="windows linux android" />

## Installing Dependencies

You will need Node.js, the React Native command line interface, and Android Studio.

<block class="mac ios android" />

### Node, Watchman

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
```

> [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) is a tool by Facebook for watching
changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

<block class="linux android" />

### Node

Follow the [installation instructions for your Linux distribution](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to install Node.js 4 or newer.

<block class='windows android' />

### Node

We recommend installing Node.js and Python2 via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org), a popular package manager for Windows. Open a Command Prompt as Administrator, then run:

```
choco install nodejs.install
choco install python2
```

> You can find additional installation options on [Node.js's Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

<block class="mac ios android" />

### The React Native CLI

Node.js comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.

Run the following command in a Terminal:

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

> If you get an error like `Cannot find module 'npmlog'`, try installing npm directly: `curl -0 -L https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`.

<block class="windows linux android" />

### The React Native CLI

Node.js comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.

Run the following command in a Terminal:

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

> If you get an error like `Cannot find module 'npmlog'`, try installing npm directly: `curl -0 -L https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`.

<block class="mac ios" />

### Xcode

The easiest way to install Xcode is via the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

<block class="mac linux windows android" />

### Android Development Environment

Setting up your development environment can be somewhat tedious if you're new to Android development. If you're already familiar with Android development, there are a few things you may need to configure. In either case, please make sure to carefully follow the next few steps.

#### 1. Download and install Android Studio

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html) provides the Android SDK and AVD (emulator) required to run and test your React Native apps.

<block class="mac android" />

> Android Studio requires the [Java SE Development Kit(JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), version 8. You can type `javac -version` in a terminal to see what version you have, if any.

```
$ javac -version
javac 1.8.0_111
```

> The version string `1.8.x_xxx` corresponds to JDK 8.

<block class="mac windows android" />

#### 2. Install the AVD and HAXM

Choose `Custom` installation when running Android Studio for the first time. Make sure the boxes next to all of the following are checked:

- `Android SDK`
- `Android SDK Platform`
- `Performance (Intel ® HAXM)`
- `Android Virtual Device`

Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.

> If you've already installed Android Studio before, you can still [install HAXM](https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/installation-instructions-for-intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager-windows) without performing a custom installation.

<block class="linux android" />

#### 2. Install the AVD and configure VM acceleration

Choose `Custom` installation when running Android Studio for the first time. Make sure the boxes next to all of the following are checked:

- `Android SDK`
- `Android SDK Platform`
- `Android Virtual Device`

Click "Next" to install all of these components, then [configure VM acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html#vm-linux) on your system.

<block class="mac linux windows android" />

#### 3. Install the Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) SDK

Android Studio installs the most recent Android SDK by default. React Native, however, requires the `Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)` SDK. To install it, launch the SDK Manager, click on "Configure" > "SDK Manager" in the "Welcome to Android Studio" screen.

> The SDK Manager can also be found within the Android Studio "Preferences" menu, under **Appearance & Behavior** → **System Settings** → **Android SDK**.

Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the `Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)` entry, then make sure the following items are all checked:

- `Google APIs`
- `Android SDK Platform 23`
- `Intel x86 Atom System Image`
- `Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image`
- `Google APIs Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image`

Next, select the "SDK Tools" tab and check the box next to "Show Package Details" here as well. Look for and expand the "Android SDK Build Tools" entry, then make sure that `Android SDK Build-Tools 23.0.1` is selected.

Finally, click "Apply" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.

<block class="mac windows linux android" />

#### 4. Set up the ANDROID_HOME environment variable

The React Native command line interface requires the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to be set up.

<block class="mac android" />

Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` (or equivalent) config file:

```
export ANDROID_HOME=${HOME}/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools
```

> Please make sure you export the correct path for `ANDROID_HOME`. If you installed the Android SDK using Homebrew, it would be located at `/usr/local/opt/android-sdk`.

<block class="linux android" />

Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` (or equivalent) config file:

```
export ANDROID_HOME=${HOME}/Android/Sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/tools
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools
```

> Please make sure you export the correct path for `ANDROID_HOME` if you did not install the Android SDK using Android Studio.

<block class="windows android" />

Go to **Control Panel** → **System and Security** → **System** → **Change settings** →
**Advanced System Settings** → **Environment variables** → **New**, then enter the path to your Android SDK.

![env variable](img/react-native-android-sdk-environment-variable-windows.png)

Restart the Command Prompt to apply the new environment variable.

> Please make sure you export the correct path for `ANDROID_HOME` if you did not install the Android SDK using Android Studio.

<block class="linux android" />

### Watchman (optional)

Follow the [Watchman installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html#build-install) to compile and install Watchman from source.

> [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) is a tool by Facebook for watching
changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance, but it's alright to skip this if you find the process to be tedious.

<block class="mac windows linux android" />

## Starting the Android Virtual Device

![Android Studio AVD Manager](img/react-native-tools-avd.png)

You can see the list of available AVDs by opening the "AVD Manager" from within Android Studio. You can also run the following command in a terminal:

```
android avd
```

Once in the "AVD Manager", select your AVD and click "Start...".

> Android Studio should have set up an Android Virtual Device for you during installation, but it is very common to run into an issue where Android Studio fails to install the AVD. You may follow the [Android Studio User Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html) to create a new AVD manually if needed.

<block class="mac ios android" />

## Testing your React Native Installation

<block class="mac ios" />

Use the React Native command line interface to generate a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject", then run `react-native run-ios` inside the newly created folder.

```
react-native init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-ios
```

You should see your new app running in the iOS Simulator shortly.

`react-native run-ios` is just one way to run your app. You can also run it directly from within Xcode or [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/).

<block class="mac android" />

Use the React Native command line interface to generate a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject", then run `react-native run-android` inside the newly created folder:

```
react-native init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your AVD shortly.

`react-native run-android` is just one way to run your app - you can also run it directly from within Android Studio or [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/).

<block class="mac ios android" />

### Modifying your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

<block class="mac ios" />

- Open `index.ios.js` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
- Hit `Command⌘ + R` in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your change!

<block class="mac android" />

- Open `index.android.js` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
- Press the `R` key twice or select `Reload` from the Developer Menu to see your change!

<block class="mac ios android" />

### That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.

<center><img src="img/react-native-congratulations.png" width="150"></img></center>

<block class="windows android" />

## Testing your React Native Installation

Use the React Native command line interface to generate a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject", then run `react-native start` inside the newly created folder to start the packager.

```
react-native init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
react-native start
```

Open a new command prompt and run `react-native run-android` inside the same folder to launch the app on your AVD.

```
react-native run-android
```

<block class="linux android" />

## Testing your React Native Installation

Use the React Native command line interface to generate a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject", then run `react-native run-android` inside the newly created folder.

```
react-native init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-android
```

<block class="windows linux android" />

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android emulator shortly.

<block class="windows android" />

> If you're targeting API level 23, the app might crash on first launch with an error smilar to `Unable to add window android.view.ViewRootImpl$W@c51fa6 -- permission denied for this window type`. To fix this, you need to go to `System settings > Apps > Configure apps > Draw over other apps` and grant the permission for the app.

NOTE: Many React Native modules haven't been tested on Marshmallow and might break. Please thoroughly test the app if you target API level 23 and file a bug report if you find that something is broken.

<block class="windows linux android" />
