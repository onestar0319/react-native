Use `SegmentedControlIOS` to render a UISegmentedControl iOS.

#### Programmatically changing selected index

The selected index can be changed on the fly by assigning the
selectedIndex prop to a state variable, then changing that variable.
Note that the state variable would need to be updated as the user
selects a value and changes the index, as shown in the example below.

````
<SegmentedControlIOS
  values={['One', 'Two']}
  selectedIndex={this.state.selectedIndex}
  onChange={(event) => {
    this.setState({selectedIndex: event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex});
  }}
/>
````
