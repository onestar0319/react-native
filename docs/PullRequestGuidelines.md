Here are some tips on reviewing pull requests:

- Does the PR miss info required in the [Pull request template](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)? Ask for it and link to the template. Add labels 'Needs revision' and 'Needs response from author'. Examples: [#6395](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/6395), [#5637](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/5637).
- Does the code style match the [Style guide](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#style-guide), especially consistency with the rest of the codebase? If not, link to the style guide and add the label 'Needs revision'.
