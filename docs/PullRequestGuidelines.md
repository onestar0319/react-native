Here are some tips on how you can help review pull requests:

- Does the PR miss info required in the [Pull request template](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)? Ask for it and link to the template.
- Does the code style match the [Style guide](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#style-guide), especially consistency with the rest of the code? If not, link to the style guide.
