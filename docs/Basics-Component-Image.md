Another basic React Native component is the [`Image`](/react-native/docs/image.html#content) component. Like `Text`, the `Image` component simply renders an image.

> An `Image` is analogous to the `<img>` HTML tag when building websites.

The simplest way to render an image is to provide a source file to that image via the `source` attribute.

This example displays a checkbox `Image` on the device.

```ReactNativeWebPlayer
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, Image } from 'react-native';

class ImageBasics extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Image source={require('./img/favicon.png')} />
    );
  }
}

// App registration and rendering
AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => ImageBasics);
```
