/**
 * The most fundamental component for building UI, `View` is a
 * container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and
 * accessibility controls, and is designed to be nested inside other views and
 * to have 0 to many children of any type. `View` maps directly to the native
 * view equivalent on whatever platform react is running on, whether that is a
 * `UIView`, `<div>`, `android.view`, etc.  This example creates a `View` that
 * wraps two colored boxes and custom component in a row with padding.
 *
 * ```
 * <View style={{flexDirection: 'row', height: 100, padding: 20}}>
 *   <View style={{backgroundColor: 'blue', flex: 0.3}} />
 *   <View style={{backgroundColor: 'red', flex: 0.5}} />
 *   <MyCustomComponent {...customProps} />
 * </View>
 * ```
 *
 * By default, `View`s have a primary flex direction of 'column', so children
 * will stack up vertically by default.  `View`s also expand to fill the parent
 * in the direction of the parent's flex direction by default, so in the case of
 * a default parent (flexDirection: 'column'), the children will fill the width,
 * but not the height.
 *
 * Many library components can be treated like plain `Views` in many cases, for
 * example passing them children, setting style, etc.
 *
 * `View`s are designed to be used with `StyleSheet`s for clarity and
 * performance, although inline styles are also supported.  It is common for
 * `StyleSheet`s to be combined dynamically.  See `StyleSheet.js` for more info.
